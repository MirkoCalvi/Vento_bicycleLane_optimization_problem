# Vento Cycle Path Charging Infrastructure

![Vento Cycle Path](vento_cycle_path_image.jpg)

Consider a long linear cycle path as Vento, or the Danube cycle path. The cycle path usually runs along the banks of a river with scarce tourist interest. However, from the main course of the cycle path, it is possible to reach places of tourist interest by making small detours.

The rapid growth of e-bike ridership is proposing the problem of deploying a suitable charging infrastructure. The charging stations should be placed in strategic positions to guarantee coverage of the entire cycle path. However, since the charging operations require a non-negligible amount of time, the charging stations should be positioned in places where alternative activities could be carried out, such as restaurants, museums, swimming pools, or other amenities. Moreover, the presence of a charging station could also induce e-cyclists to discover new places and generate positive externalities.
